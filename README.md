## Description
Want to go back to the olden days of classic arcade games... yet ones that can actually run on your PC without an emulator... JSR LDA BEQ-- FLASH BACKS!!!

Anyways... if you haven't filled up the stack yet with your subroutine jumps and breaks you might have a little time to play Table Tennis... [a-totally-not-rip-off-of-this-game](https://youtu.be/tvpj6c7xjM4?si=XbQPs-ZJ79uu63GO).

Now in 4K (actually 200x192 which scales by a factor of 4)!!!

As you can tell... if I didn't post this mostly-completed project now... it would never be finished!! HAHAHAHAHA!!!

Now including a totally non-intuitive control scheme:

- SPACE = toggle difficulty/hit ball

- ENTER = ENTER

- A/D = move paddle


ARE YOU SOLD!?!?! IT'S FREE SO YOU ARE BY DEFAULT!!!

HAHAHAHAHA!!!

Also, if this game bores you, please read [this](https://cdrdv2.intel.com/v1/dl/getContent/671200) and come back. It should change your mind.

## Build Instructions
*I'm surprised you found this down here...*

If you don't want to build it, check out the game on [itch](https://thbop.itch.io/table-tennis).

On itch I made it easy, but since this is github and since y'all are developers... you ought to look up yourself: "how to build a raylib project in C"

*I bet it's super hard*
